## St - Simple Terminal built By Kiriyama

<b>Features</b>
- Not bloated, yet.
- Simple, with multi font and emoji support.
- Transparent, litreally.
- It is also the part of my auto install script on my [homepage](https://github.com/AvishekPD)
- just ```sudo make clean install``` to built and install it
- if st is crashing for you, just install ligxft-bgra from aur on arch or from [git](https://github.com/uditkarode/libxft-bgra)
